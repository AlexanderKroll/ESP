# Description
This repository contains the code and datasets to reproduce the results and figures and to train the models from our paper "The substrate scopes of enzymes: a general prediction model based on machine and deep learning".


#### For people interested in using the trained prediction model, we implemented a [web server](https://github.com/AlexanderKroll/KM_prediction_function) that allows an easy use of our trained model.
